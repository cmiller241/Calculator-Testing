# Calculator Testing
## Getting Started
The frontend file for the calculator is singularly index.html which is included in the root directory. The application can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modus. Invalid inputs **should** yield an error message. 
## Testing
Testing for the calculator is done with Selenium and Cucumber. There is a positive feature file showcasing the calculator's ability to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modus. And there is a negative feature file showcasing the calculator's ability to handle inappropriate inputs (text, etc.). The tests can be run via the MainRunner runner under com.revature.
